BUGFIX: unfocused input list items

the input in listItem (where i change the name of the todo once set) was unfocusing each time i was typing a letter, this is because the state was set outside of it. to fix this, the input now stores data in a useState inside the component on change, when he loses the focus he will trigger the handleChange (this happens when the user clicks away from it)
